# Single cell replication package

This package contains a series of vignettes that reproduce published
SCP data analyses. Emphasis is put on standardization of the workflows.

## Prerequisites

All vignettes are pre-compiled and can be found on the 
[website](https://uclouvain-cbio.github.io/SCP.replication/index.html)
under the `Articles` tab. Therefore, there are no software 
prerequisites. 

## Reproduction of SCP data analyses

The currently available reproduction vignettes are listed below. 

### Reproduction of the SCoPE2 analysis (Specht et al. 2021)
