\title{Count Unique Features

This function counts the number of unique features per sample. A
grouping structure can be provided to count higher level features
from assays, for example counting the number of unique proteins
from PSM data.}
\usage{
countUniqueFeatures(object, i, groupBy = NULL, colDataName = "count")
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{QFeatures}.}

\item{i}{A \code{numeric()} or \code{character()} vector indicating from
which assays the \code{rowData} should be taken.}

\item{groupBy}{A \code{character(1)} indicating the variable name in
the \code{rowData} that contains the grouping variable, for
instance to count the unique number of peptides or proteins
expressed in each samples (column). If \code{groupBy} is missing,
the number of non zero elements per sample will be stored.}

\item{colDataName}{A \code{character(1)} giving the name of the new
variable in the \code{colData} where the number of unique features
will be stored. The name cannot already exist in the
\code{colData}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{QFeatures}.
