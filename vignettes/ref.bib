  abstract = "Analysis by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry
              (LC-MS/MS) can identify and quantify thousands of proteins in
              microgram-level samples, such as those comprised of thousands of
              cells. This process, however, remains challenging for smaller
              samples, such as the proteomes of single mammalian cells, because
              reduced protein levels reduce the number of confidently sequenced
              peptides. To alleviate this reduction, we developed Data-driven
              Alignment of Retention Times for IDentification (DART-ID).
              DART-ID implements principled Bayesian frameworks for global
              retention time (RT) alignment and for incorporating RT estimates
              towards improved confidence estimates of
              peptide-spectrum-matches. When applied to bulk or to single-cell
              samples, DART-ID increased the number of data points by 30-50\%
              at 1\% FDR, and thus decreased missing data. Benchmarks indicate
              excellent quantification of peptides upgraded by DART-ID and
              support their utility for quantitative analysis, such as
              identifying cell types and cell-type specific proteins. The
              additional datapoints provided by DART-ID boost the statistical
              power and double the number of proteins identified as
              differentially abundant in monocytes and T-cells. DART-ID can be
              applied to diverse experimental designs and is freely available

              empirical Bayes methods",
  author   = "Johnson, W Evan and Li, Cheng and Rabinovic, Ariel",
  abstract = "Non-biological experimental variation or ``batch effects'' are
              commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray
              experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from
              these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data
              sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power
              to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical
              considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require
              the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is
              inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch
              effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from
              data, but these are often complicated and require large batch
              sizes ( > 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray
              studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing
              methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and
              non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for
              batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes
              and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We
              illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that
              our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in
              practice. Software for our method is freely available at:

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Macrophages are innate immune cells with diverse
              functional and molecular phenotypes. This diversity is largely
              unexplored at the level of single-cell proteomes because of the
              limitations of quantitative single-cell protein analysis.
              RESULTS: To overcome this limitation, we develop SCoPE2, which
              substantially increases quantitative accuracy and throughput
              while lowering cost and hands-on time by introducing automated
              and miniaturized sample preparation. These advances enable us to
              analyze the emergence of cellular heterogeneity as homogeneous
              monocytes differentiate into macrophage-like cells in the absence
              of polarizing cytokines. SCoPE2 quantifies over 3042 proteins in
              1490 single monocytes and macrophages in 10 days of instrument
              time, and the quantified proteins allow us to discern single
              cells by cell type. Furthermore, the data uncover a continuous
              gradient of proteome states for the macrophages, suggesting that
              macrophage heterogeneity may emerge in the absence of polarizing
              cytokines. Parallel measurements of transcripts by 10$\times$
              Genomics suggest that our measurements sample 20-fold more
              protein copies than RNA copies per gene, and thus, SCoPE2
              supports quantification with improved count statistics. This
              allowed exploring regulatory interactions, such as interactions
              between the tumor suppressor p53, its transcript, and the
              transcripts of genes regulated by p53. CONCLUSIONS: Even in a
              homogeneous environment, macrophage proteomes are heterogeneous.
              This heterogeneity correlates to the inflammatory axis of
              classically and alternatively activated macrophages. Our
              methodology lays the foundation for automated and quantitative
              single-cell analysis of proteins by mass spectrometry and
              demonstrates the potential for inferring transcriptional and
              post-transcriptional regulation from variability across single

              workflows for differential expression (DE) analysis of proteins
              impose important challenges on the data analysis due to
              peptide-specific effects and context dependent missingness of
              peptide intensities. Peptide-based workflows, like MSqRob, test
              for DE directly from peptide intensities and outper-form
              summarization methods which first aggregate MS1 peptide
              intensities to protein intensities before DE analysis. However,
              these methods are computationally expensive, often hard to
              understand for the non-specialised end-user, and do not provide
              protein summaries, which are important for visualisation or
              downstream processing. In this work, we therefore evaluate
              state-of-the-art summarization strategies using a benchmark
              spike-in dataset and discuss why and when these fail compared to
              the state-of-the-art peptide based model, MSqRob. Based on this
              evaluation, we propose a novel summarization strategy,
              MSqRob-Sum, which estimates MSqRob's model parameters in a
              two-stage procedure circumventing the drawbacks of peptide-based
              workflows. MSqRobSum maintains MSqRob's superior performance,
              while providing useful protein expression summaries for plotting
              and downstream analysis. Summarising peptide to protein
              intensities considerably reduces the computational complexity,
              the memory footprint and the model complexity, and makes it
              easier to disseminate DE inferred on protein summaries. Moreover,
              MSqRobSum provides a highly modular analysis framework, which
              provides researchers with full flexibility to develop data
              analysis workflows tailored towards their specific applications.",

              functionality and can be used in conjunction with more MS
              platforms. Here we present an updated protocol covering the most

              isobaric labeling techniques. This protocol presents a complete
              description of the parameters used in MaxQuant, as well as of the
              configuration options of its integrated search engine, Andromeda.
              This protocol update describes an adaptation of an existing
              protocol that substantially modifies the technique. Important
              concepts of shotgun proteomics and their implementation in

              strategies and the control of false-discovery rates (FDRs), as
              well as the analysis of post-translational modifications (PTMs).
